# Meduzzen_Intership
Meduzzen intership consists of 3 different projects. 
<br> The plan is to complete all three projects in a sequence: 1. CV 2. NLP Text 3. Email. IN that case the beginning analyzation of NLP and Email projects are not that deep and meaningful due to the lack of time and focus. 
<br> The repo consists of 3 different folders. Each folder for each project.
<br> Every project has it's own README.md file which describes my personal point of view on the problems, technologies that are used, thoughts during the process.
