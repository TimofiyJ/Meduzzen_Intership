<br>1.Problem:
<br> Email classification and extraction
<br>2.Challanges:
<br> data extraction, 30+ languages support
<br>3.Data preprocessing:
<br> Data preprocessing plays crucial role since meaning of words plays big role we need to get rid of useless words
<br> 4.Thoughts on libs:
<br> The choice between libraries is not that broad so I have chosen spaCy and NLTK due to high performance, availability of Named Entity Recognition, excellent support for dependency parsing, community and ecosystems. Right now the main idea is to use naive Bayes or bag of words

<br> 6. Main framework:
<br> The main tech stack would be based on recommendations and my personal experience:
<br> Python 3.11, JSON, Paydantic, Gradio, FastAPI, scikit-learn, numpy, tensorflow, re, beautifulsoup4
